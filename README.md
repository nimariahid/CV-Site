# CV Site
This site is built to update latest status of myself and for job searching. Feel free to fork project for your own use. The theme is derived from template on https://www.styleshout.com/ and modified accordingly to my need.

Django framework is integrated to generate dynamic content in education, work and portfolio section. Those content can be modified through Django admin site directly. 

An apache server is hosted to serve static resources which is automatically collected on container creation.

Production site [kao.po-wen.de](https://kao.po-wen.de/)
